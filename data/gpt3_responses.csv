What's the difference between COVID-19 and the flu?,"The most significant difference is that COVID-19 is a new disease and there is still much unknown about it, including how it spreads and what the most effective treatments are. Flu viruses, on the other hand, are well-studied and there are effective vaccines and treatments available."
How does the vaccine work?,"The standard vaccine for bouts of influenza is known as “trivalent”. It contains three parts of the virus. There is another version of the vaccine known as “quadrivalent” that contains all four of the identified influenza viruses. The quadraqlent vaccine was introduced for the past two influenza seasons.

What’s in the vaccine?

The intersection of three of the main ingredients of the vaccine is interesting. One is formaldehyde,"
What are the side effects of the vaccine?,"The side effects of the flu vaccine depend on the type of vaccine you get. The most common side effects from the injectable flu vaccine are soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site. These side effects generally last less than two days.

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness."
How is the virus mutating?,"There is no certain answer to this question as the virus is constantly evolving and mutating. However, some possible explanations include genetic recombination (when two different strains of the virus come into contact and combine their genetic material) and mutations (random changes in the genetic code). These processes can occur spontaneously or may be induced by external factors, such as UV light or chemicals."
What are the long-term effects of the virus?,There is currently no evidence that the virus causes long-term effects.
Are there any home remedies for the virus?,"The most common home remedy for the flu is to take over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain. Drinking plenty of fluids, getting rest, and gargling with warm salt water can also help."

What precautions should pregnant women take?,"Pregnant women should avoid exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. They should also eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise."
How is the vaccine distributed?,"The vaccine is distributed through a network of state and local public health departments, and through some managed care organizations. It is also available through some private healthcare providers and some pharmacists."
How many doses of the vaccine are required?,"Two doses are required for full immunization, given four to six weeks apart."
Can I get infected after vaccination?,"After a COVID-19 vaccination, you may have mild side effects. These are normal and part of the process that helps your body build immunity. You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.

Can I infect someone else with the vaccine?

COVID-19 vaccinations are currently only available to frontline staff and Risk Group 1 sadly, however you will be in a much lower risk of infecting others so it would be beneficial to get vaccinated; the benefits far"
How do I report side effects from the vaccine?,You should contact your health care provider if you have any concerns about side effects after vaccination. Most people don`t have side effects after receiving a vaccine. For more information see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Is there a digital passport for vaccination?,Yes. The EU has proposed a digital passport for vaccination.
How is the pandemic affecting children?,"There is no one answer to this question as the pandemic is affecting children in different ways. Some children may be worried about themselves or their loved ones getting sick, while others may be struggling with the changes to their routine or the loss of social interaction. Some children may be experiencing anxiety or depression as a result of the pandemic."
What's the difference between different vaccines?,Different vaccines are designed to protect against different diseases. Some vaccines are more effective than others at preventing certain diseases.
How are hospitals coping with the pandemic?,"Hospitals are coping with the pandemic by hiring more staff, increasing their capacity, and stocking up on supplies."
What's the role of WHO in the pandemic?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for global public health.

What are antibody tests?,"Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, are blood tests that check for antibodies in the blood. Antibodies are proteins that the body produces in response to a foreign substance, such as a virus."
How reliable are the COVID-19 tests?,"There are several types of tests available to detect the new coronavirus:

Molecular or nucleic acid test (PCR): This is the most common test type. It is highly accurate, but it can take a few days for results. Antigen test (RAT): Antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests but can provide results in approximately 15 minutes. Antibody tests: Antibody tests can be used to determine if someone has had the virus in"
How is contact tracing done?,"Contact tracing is performed by interviewing individuals who have tested positive for a infectious disease and asking them about the people they have been in close contact with. Once identified, public health workers reach out to these individuals and provide them with information about the infection and what they should do to prevent its spread."
What is the reproduction number of the virus?,"There is no definitive answer to this question as the reproductive number of the virus can change over time and vary from place to place. However, estimates of the reproductive number range from 2 to 3. This means that, on average, each infected person will infect two or three other people."
How are recovered patients monitored?,Recovered patients are typically monitored by their primary care physicians.
Are there any post-recovery complications?,"It is very rare to experience any post-recovery complications from face lift surgery. However, as with any surgery, there is always a small risk of infection or other complications."
